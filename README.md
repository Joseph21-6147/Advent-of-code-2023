# Advent-of-code-2023

These are my solutions to the AoC (Advent of Code) puzzles so far. 

The flcTimer.h and .cpp and my_utility.h and .cpp are two of my own libs I use for timing and aligned printing.

In my solutions I use three development phases:
* EXAMPLE - uses hard coded input, just to check if the solution algorithm works. I use the example data from the puzzles here;
* TEST    - uses small text file input, typically the same example data as before. This phase is aimed at checking if my file input is working properly;
* PUZZLE  - this phase is used to generate the answer to the puzzle;

Therefore, you find an input.test.txt and input.puzzle.txt for each day. Typically 

Have fun!

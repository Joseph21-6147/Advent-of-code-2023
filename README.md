# Advent-of-code-2023

These are my solutions to the AoC (Advent of Code) puzzles so far. 

The flcTimer.h and .cpp and my_utility.h and .cpp are two of my own libs I use for timing and aligned printing.

In my solutions I use three development phases:
EXAMPLE - uses hard coded input, just to check if the solution algorithm works;
TEST    - uses small text file input, primarily to check if the file input is working properly;
PUZZLE  - this is the phase to generate the answer to the puzzle;

Therefore, you find a input.test.txt and input.puzzle.txt for each day.

Have fun!
